# Airline Passenger Satisfaction

This Is A Project for California State University Los Angeles CS4661
The goal is to determine what factors lead to highest customer satisfaction for an Airline
This Project Comes from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction

# Progress and Roadblocks
- Loaded in the data set
- established pandas train and test data
- attempted nearest neighbor classification
    - This failed due to certain data columns being in a string format. Data Manipulation required
- Mapped out all columns that need re-mapping and listed its unique values

# Todo:
- Re-map the string data to number format
- experiment with knn classification or other data model approaches.
